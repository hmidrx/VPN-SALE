# Authorization

RBAC with fine-grained permissions, resource ownership checks, reseller tenancy rules, separation of duties, mandatory reasons for sensitive actions, optional dual approval, and explicit authorization tests.

## Milestone 1A RBAC foundation

Milestone 1A adds persistence for roles, permissions, role-permission pairs, and administrator-role assignments. Permission codes are stable dotted machine strings. The initial idempotent seed catalog includes administrator, role, user, session, audit, and security management permissions only; no product, payment, wallet, order, panel, or provisioning permissions are introduced.

## Milestone 1D-A identity administration
Milestone 1D-A introduces backend-only management APIs protected by database-resolved permissions. Effective permissions are loaded from active role assignments for each protected request, disabled/locked administrators are denied immediately, and final active Super Admin safeguards prevent disabling or stripping the last privileged administrator path. Administrator invitations store only token hashes and return plaintext tokens once. Customer management uses documented status transitions and revokes sessions on sensitive restrictions. Audit logs are query-only and append-oriented; security events add acknowledgment/resolution workflow state. Management UI and all commerce/provider functionality remain out of scope.

## Milestone 1D-B identity administration frontend
The administrator frontend adds permission-aware identity management pages for administrators, invitations, roles, permissions, customers, sessions, audit logs, and security events. The UI consumes the existing management APIs, reuses memory-only access tokens, HttpOnly refresh cookies, CSRF headers, and single-flight refresh, and never becomes the authoritative authorization layer. Direct unauthorized routes must show controlled forbidden states while backend permission checks remain decisive.

Invitation tokens are displayed exactly once from ephemeral component state, are never placed in URLs, localStorage, sessionStorage, logs, or analytics, and are cleared after acknowledgment. Audit metadata rendering is defensive and suppresses secret-like keys. Session pages show only normalized safe metadata returned by the backend. The security center supports acknowledgment/resolution language without implying that acknowledgment removes the underlying event.

## Milestone 2-A catalog permissions
Catalog administration uses `catalog.read`, `catalog.create`, `catalog.update`, `catalog.publish`, `pricing.read`, `pricing.manage` and `quotes.read`. Customer browsing exposes only active published data; quote creation requires authenticated active customers.

## Milestone 2-B1 catalog administration note

Milestone 2-B1 adds an administrator-only catalog console in `apps/admin-web` that consumes the real Milestone 2-A catalog and pricing APIs. The backend remains authoritative for authorization, lifecycle transitions, publication validation, immutable published versions, price-list overlap, pricing validity, and concurrency conflicts. The frontend keeps access tokens in memory, sends CSRF headers for mutations, avoids storing draft API responses in browser storage, displays machine codes LTR, treats money as integer rial with explicit toman display, uses fixed-day duration labels, and keeps fulfillment requirements provider-neutral. Customer storefront, wallet/order/payment/provider/provisioning work remains out of scope.

## Milestone 2-B2 customer catalog authorization
The backend remains authoritative for product visibility, account-status eligibility, quote ownership and quote creation. ACTIVE customers may use protected preview/quote flows; suspended, blocked, deactivated or unknown statuses fail closed according to backend policy.
