## Milestone 0 verification

Milestone 0 uses GitHub Actions as the authoritative verification environment. The main workflow `.github/workflows/verify.yml` runs backend, frontend, Docker Compose, and security jobs on Ubuntu with Python 3.12, Node.js 22, PostgreSQL 16, Redis 7, and Docker Compose v2.

Repository scripts mirror CI categories and are intended for Codespaces and CI reuse:

- `scripts/verify-backend.sh`
- `scripts/verify-frontend.sh`
- `scripts/verify-docker.sh`
- `scripts/security-scan.sh`
- `scripts/verify-all.sh`

The current no-lockfile npm installation path is temporary. Once `package-lock.json` is generated in Codespaces and committed, CI and Codespaces should use `npm ci` for reproducible frontend installs.
